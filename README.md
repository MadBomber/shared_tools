  <p>A Ruby gem providing a collection of tools for use with tool-supporting LLMs</p>

## Installation

```ruby
# TODO: ? change name to ruby_llm-shared_tools ??
gem install shared_tools
```

## Special Thanks

This gem was originally inspired by Kevin's [omniai-tools](https://github.com/ksylvest/omniai-tools) gem. SharedTools has since evolved to focus exclusively on RubyLLM support.
